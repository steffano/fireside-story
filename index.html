      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>the sound of a howling woof could be heard throught the thunder </p>
      <p>I stare past the reflection of the fire in the window, stirring my whiskey glass slowly. "Where could she be?" I wonder to myself.</p>
      <p> "It's not like her to be late. It's not like her to not call," I think as I drink the rest of my whiskey and take my coat out of the closet.</p>
      <p>I lock up, and make my way down the fire escape. "Man it's cold tonight!" I think as I flip my collar up, covering the back of my neck.</p>
